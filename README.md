## Background
Aircraft engine maintenance is a critical aspect of aviation operations, playing a vital role in ensuring the safety, reliability, and efficiency of air travel. The maintenance of aircraft engines is a complex and highly regulated process that involves various preventive and corrective measures to keep engines in optimal working condition.

The goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data analysis tasks on an aircraft engine maintenance dataset representing different aircraft engine health and operational parameters. The dataset simulates real-world scenarios in which engines operate under varying conditions, and our objective is to gain insights into the data through EDA, statistical analysis, and visualizations.

This is a critical task for the aviation industry, as it not only informs management on how to enhance safety measures but also helps highlight maintenance costs and increase operational efficiency.

## Dataset
The aircraft dataset contains historical data from various aircraft engines. Each row in the dataset represents a specific engine at a given point in time.

### Data Dictionary:
- **Engine_ID**: Unique identifier for each aircraft engine (Integer)
- **Timestamp**: Date and time when the data was recorded (Datetime)
- **Temperature**: Temperature of the aircraft engine in degrees Celsius (Float)
- **Pressure**: Pressure of the aircraft engine in units relevant to the dataset (Float)
- **Rotational_Speed**: Rotational speed of the aircraft engine in revolutions per minute (RPM) (Float)
- **Engine_Health**: A measure of the overall health of the aircraft engine (Float)
- **Engine_Failure**: Binary indicator of engine failure (0 for ‘no engine failure’, 1 for ‘engine failure’) (Integer, Binary)
- **Fuel_Consumption**: Amount of fuel consumed by the engine (Float)
- **Oil_Temperature**: Temperature of the engine oil (Float)
- **Altitude**: Altitude at which the engine operates (Float)
- **Humidity**: Humidity level in the environment where the engine operates (Float)
- **Maintenance_Needed**: Indicates whether maintenance is needed for the engine (1 for needed, 0 for not needed) (Integer, Binary)

## Task Methodology
The project involves several key steps to analyze and predict the maintenance needs of aircraft engines.

### Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values, outliers, and any anomalies in the dataset to ensure data quality.

### Data Exploration
- Perform basic statistical analysis to understand the distribution of each feature.
- Identify patterns and trends in the data.

### Univariate Analysis
- Analyze individual features to gain insights.
- Examine the distribution of key variables.

### Bivariate Analysis
- Explore relationships between pairs of variables.
- Identify correlations and dependencies.

### Multivariate Analysis
- Investigate interactions between three or more variables.
- Discover complex patterns and dependencies.

### Data Visualization
- Create visualizations to effectively communicate insights.
- Utilize plots, charts, and graphs to represent the data.

### Feature Engineering
- Derive new features that might enhance predictive performance.
- Consider time-based features, rolling averages, or other relevant transformations.

### Data Summary
- Summarize key findings from the exploratory analysis.
- Highlight insights that could inform the predictive maintenance model.

### Predictive Analysis
- Leverage different machine learning classification algorithms to predict if an engine will require maintenance or not.

## Results
The analysis and model development led to significant insights into the factors affecting engine maintenance needs. Key results include:
- Identification of critical parameters influencing engine health and maintenance.
- Development of a predictive model with a reasonable accuracy to forecast maintenance needs.
- Visualization of patterns and trends that can help inform maintenance scheduling and operational efficiency improvements.

The detailed procedures, analysis, and results can be found in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook.

## Conclusion
